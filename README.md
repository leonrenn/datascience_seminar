## ParameterizedNeuralNetwork
In ***High Energy Physics*** it is common that one has to decide if the data that is taken is from some specific signal ($H_{a}$) or from the background ($H_{0}$).<br>
This is simple binary hypothesis testing. For big experiments and complicated processes the likelihood may not be known and therefore has to be learned. <br>
Neural Network provide a very nice approach to this problem. In this case, a NN is trained on parameterized (means as hypothesis) on 1 and 2 dimesional data.
